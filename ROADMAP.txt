ROADMAP : Future Features

=========================


Synch and global list at the same time
  rg / writes to data, plus data/.latest, rm data/.latest
  rg -l reads data/.latest, otherwise same as normal, no synch (deprecate dry run)


check for forks, same repo in different location
  sometimes a fork is not intended,
  just a copy in the wrong directory structure
  check the first commit hash against the abstract paths


check for parallel forks
  currently we only know about forks when fast-forward
  synchs fail. Should have some indication that two repos
  may have the same number of commit log lines, but are
  not the same.


check for uncovered
  look for data, particularly in /home that is not
  covered by git repository or explicitly gitignored
